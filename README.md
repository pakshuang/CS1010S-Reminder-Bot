# CS1010S-Reminder-Bot
![GitHub release (latest by date)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/pakshuang/CS1010S-Reminder-Bot)

Telegram bot that reminds students about deadlines, exams, and more for the NUS module CS1010S Programming Methodology.

## Improvement ideas that I'll eventually implement:
- Multiple reminders for the day should be combined into a single message
- Increasing the lead time and compiling the reminders from now till then (e.g. if lead time is 3 days, daily reminders will list the upcoming deadlines within the next 3 days)
- Reminders to start on certain tasks, such as posting weekly lecture reflections on the module's forum
- Issue: These deadlines are only for those who have been keeping up with their assignments. If you submit some tasks late enough, all subsequent deadlines are delayed, meaning the reminders will not be entirely accurate for those individuals.
